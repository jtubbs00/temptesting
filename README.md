## Iris
Iris is my dog. She is a white lab. We *thought* she was going to be a yellow lab when we got her, but her color never darkened. It does darken though, when she rolls in either dirt or grass. Iris **loves** attention. SHe will go up to *anyone* and try to get their attention.
## Ringo and George
Ringo and George are my cats. Ringo is fat and george is unnaturally skinny. THey are both pretyy small for cats, with small heads and short bodys. It is *weird*
